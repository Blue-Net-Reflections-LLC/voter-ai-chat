## Overview

[VoterAI](http://voterai.chat) is a conversational web application designed to empower Georgia voters, election stakeholders, and campaign managers by providing timely, data-driven insights into voter registration and district information. The platform simulates a ChatGPT-like interface, enabling users to pose natural language queries, which are then transformed into SQL through a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. This approach allows VoterAI to present precise results drawn from a locally maintained database of voter registration records originally sourced from the Georgia Secretary of State. 


### Key Features

- **Conversational Interface:**  
  Interact with the system as if chatting with an assistant. Ask questions in plain English, and the platform handles the rest, making data exploration more approachable and intuitive.


- **RAG-Enabled NLP to SQL Conversion:**  
  Harness the power of a Retrieval Augmented Generation pipeline to convert user queries into optimized SQL statements. This ensures that the responses are grounded in actual data rather than relying solely on inferred knowledge.

[//]: # (  Leverage data sourced directly from the Georgia Secretary of State. The records are periodically loaded into VoterAIâ€™s own database, ensuring the platform remains current, accurate, and free from any dependency on direct external access.)

- **District & Representative Insights:**  
  Explore voter districts, learn about elected officials, and gain a clearer understanding of the political landscape. Identify patterns in voter distribution to better strategize engagement and outreach efforts.


- **Campaign Strategy & Outreach:**  
  Determine high-impact areas, identify demographic segments, and develop targeted strategies to enhance voter turnout. Campaign managers can analyze trends, measure performance, and refine outreach methods based on evidence rather than guesswork.


- **Visualizations & Data Presentation:**  
  Translate complex voter information into visually appealing charts and maps. All visualization queries are URL-encoded for stability, while QuickChart.io and the Google Maps Static API power rich graphical outputs, helping users see and understand patterns at a glance.


- **Privacy & Compliance:**  
  Uphold stringent data protection standards. No personally identifiable information (PII) is disclosed, and all voter data is handled responsibly, ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations.


### Getting Started

Visit [http://voterai.chat](http://voterai.chat) to begin exploring voter data, learning about districts, and developing data-backed strategies.


## Running VoterAI locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.


> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various OpenAI and authentication provider accounts.


1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`

2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`

3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`


```bash

pnpm install

pnpm dev

```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
